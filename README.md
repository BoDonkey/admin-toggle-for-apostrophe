# admin-toggle-for-apostrophe
This extension allows toggle of the visibility of the ApostropheCMS adminBar for use with templates with fixed headers.

## Usage:

After installation add the module to the `app.js` file. A green toggle button will appear on all pages if logged in as anything besides `guest`. Clicking this will hide the visibility of the adminBar in order to see templates where the top section is positioned 'absolute' to the top of the page.
